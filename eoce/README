======unix fall2023 eoce======
The End of Course Experience (eoce) satisfies the fourth discrete grading
component  of the  course. It  is meant  to evaluate  your knowledge  and
understanding gained through the semester.

Unlike the regular weekly projects, the  purpose of which is to promote a
learning and  understanding of the concepts  of the course, this  EoCE is
meant more  as a demonstration  of your proficiency in  understanding and
utilizing the concepts and skills obtained, showing me how productive you
can be with the experiences gained.

=====Rules=====
Presented within will be various activities evaluating your knowledge and
experience gained this  semester. In places where you are  able, the more
you write (ie comment) and explain  topics the better the chance you will
have of  receiving full  credit (and alternatively,  the more  credit you
will receive should something defer correctness).

Unless otherwise  specified, the components  on this experience  are open
resource with  the exception  of other individuals.  In that  respect, it
is  **CLOSED  PERSON**.  This  means  you are  not  to  communicate  with
other  people  (either in  the  class  or  otherwise),  in real  life  or
electronically. Use your own knowledge, use your own skills, and use your
own ability to access the allowed resources  to aid you in coming up with
your well thought out responses to each activity.

You are allowed,  and expected, to seek clarification on  any activity by
asking me. But the  aim here is to evaluate what you  have learned, so do
not  expect  tutoring.  Any  help  should be  prompted  by  a  well-asked
question.  The better  and more  informed your  questions, the  better my
responses MAY be. In many ways, I designed this EoCE premised on each and
every  one of  you interacting  with me  through the  asking of  informed
questions. Those  that do not  take advantage  of asking such  calibre of
questions and  instead end up  struggling, please know that  you're doing
this wrong. But also know that, the aim here is for you to accomplish the
various tasks through your own understanding  of the task and concepts at
hand, and not to outsource your thinking and remembering to others.

You are to  do at least **N-1** of the  **N** available items. Submission
is to be as  a submitted archive to the usual  and appropriate place (the
'eoce' project  via 'make submit'  on lab46). Please amass  all pertinent
files in the respective subdirectory so  you can submit everything in one
fell swoop.

To maximize  any credit received  (or to minimize points  lost), optimize
your  submission  for  an  organized  and  easy-to-read  presentation  of
information that conforms  with each section's stated  guidelines. In the
case of programs or scripts written, ensure that you are following proper
and  consistent commenting/documentation  and indentation  practices. Use
well-named variables  (at least 4  symbols long),  and be mindful  of how
your  particular  files  submitted  will  appear  on  a  reasonably-sized
terminal (most of my terminals are 80-90 characters wide), should that be
the contextually relevant destination of output.

The  EoCE is  worth 26  points  of your  overall grade  (projects (52)  +
participation (13)  + journal  (13) +  eoce (26)  = 104),  representing a
distinct  fourth  category  within  the  grading  policy  of  the  course
(Projects, Journal, Participation, and EoCE).

====Finals Week Availability====
While some  classes are allocated  a specific meeting time  during finals
week,  I make  all  such times  available  should you  be  free and  have
questions. As  such, finals week  in **CHM123** will look  something like
this:

  * Tuesday,   December 12th, 2023 from 08:00AM-05:30PM
  * Wednesday, December 13th, 2023 from 02:30PM-05:30PM
  * Thursday,  December 14th, 2023 from 11:15AM-02:15PM

Do note,  the discord remains  available for  questions, and there  is no
need for you to be physically present at a given time during finals week.
These are  merely resources available to  you should you wish  to utilize
them in the appropriate manners they are available to be used.

=====Obtaining the EoCE files=====
Using the 'grabit' tool  on lab46, you can obtain your  copy of the EoCE.
As  a  first step,  change  into  a  location  suitable for  storing  and
organizing your files within your repository:

<cli>
lab46:~$ cd ~/src/fall2023/unix
lab46:~/src/fall2023/unix$ 
</cli>

... and run the grabit tool as pertinent for your class desig:

<cli>
lab46:~/src/fall2023/unix$ grabit unix eoce
</cli>

Please, do not change the name of the directory from eoce/.

Change into that directory:

<cli>
lab46:~/src/fall2023/unix$ cd eoce
lab46:~/src/fall2023/unix/eoce$ 
</cli>

Use "ls" to  list files, read any README files  (with cat/less/nano), and
"cd" into the various subdirectories.

Further information can  be found in various README  files located amidst
the directories within the eoce; please be sure to read them.

For some activities there may also  be some form of verification resource
made  available to  you. Be  sure  to utilize  this to  help ensure  your
implementation meets the requirements laid out in each section.

You will notice  a directory tree, resembling the  following, within your
extracted EoCE data:

<code>
       eoce/
        |
        +-- README
        |
        +-- Makefile
        |
        +-- 0x0/
        |
        +-- 0x1/
        |
        +-- 0x2/
        |
       ...
</code>

Within  each "0x"  subdirectory  you  will find  a  README  file and  any
supporting files related to the particular activity you are tasked with.

=====Errata=====
Sometimes  typos  or  problems  are   discovered.  Should  there  be  any
such  discoveries,  updates/corrections will  be  made  available in  the
eoce/errata/ directory in the class public directory.

=====Submission=====
The DEADLINE FOR  SUBMISSION of this EoCE is  11:59:59pm (that's 23:59:59
in  24-hour time)  Thursday, December  14th, 2023.  This is  the ultimate
deadline for any and all coursework. There is no "late", only "too late".
Don't be that person, not with this.

I would highly  recommend not waiting until the last  moment (or even the
last week) to start on this. It  has been released weeks in advance, with
the intention that you  chip away at it a little bit at  a time, over the
course of weeks.

To submit, please  change into your base eoce directory  within your home
directory:

<cli>
lab46:~$ cd ~/src/fall2023/unix/eoce
lab46:~/src/fall2023/unix/eoce$ 
</cli>

... and run "make submit":

<cli>
lab46:~/src/fall2023/unix/eoce$ make submit
</cli>

As with the projects and other deliverables this semester, you can submit
early (and worthwhile,  early submissions or extra work (ie  doing N of N
available problems) can  receive up to 7 bonus points  (applicable to the
EoCE grading  component)), and also submit  as many times as  you desire.
Note that  when you submit, that  resets the timestamp from  which I will
evaluate any early submission bonus points or on-time eligibility.

Eligibility of any received bonus points on the EoCE are ultimately up to
my decision: if you have genuinely put forth just and honest effort  that
is worthy of this undertaking, you will likely receive any eligible bonus
points as described. If you are more calculating and avoiding of  work in
your EoCE efforts, I reserve the right not to grant any bonus points.

Also, if I notice any cases of rule violations (people  overhelping  each
other instead of letting each individual complete the EoCE on  their  own
accord and ability), you risk forfeiting any/all bonus points or even any
credit for the section(s) that you violated the rules on.

Additionally:

  * Solutions not abiding  by spirit of project will be  subject to a 50%
    overall deduction
  * Solutions  not  utilizing descriptive  why and  how comments  will be
    subject to a 50% overall deduction
  * Solutions not utilizing indentation to promote scope and clarity will
    be subject to a 50% overall deduction
  * Solutions not organized and easy to read are subject to a 50% overall
    deduction

Good luck!
