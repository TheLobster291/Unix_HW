========================
Your task here should be a familiar one: a letter division, just as we've
encountered all semester. This one is  of the solve4 variety (ie not only
do  you have  to solve  for the  key and  provide a  written step-by-step
solution, but you also have to solve for the quotient and the remainder).

Additionally, the puzzle  difficulty has been increased  to 'hard', which
should provide more of a challenge than the 'medium'-rated puzzles you've
had prior.

Be sure to submit the appropriately-named and formatted files persuant to
stated pctX  project specifications  (especially where  a solve4-category
puzzle is concerned).

For **pzlchk** related transactions, you  may use the project designation
of **pctF**
