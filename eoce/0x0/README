========================
Your task here is to implement a bash script that implements a multi-base
multiplication table, based on command-line arguments provided.

Script
======
Write a  bash script that  generates a  multiplication table for  a given
range within a specified number base:

  * looks for and uses the following arguments (arguments are decimal):
    * ${1} is the base specifier (2-16, default is 10)
    * ${2} is an optional upper bound (default is base-1)
    * ${3} is an optional lower bound (default is 1)

  * valid  lower and upper bound  values should fall within  the range of
    0-99

  * if a provided argument contains invalid information, display an error
    and exit with a value of 3 + argument number:
    * display "ERROR: invalid base"        for invalid ${1}
    * display "ERROR: invalid upper bound" for invalid ${2}
    * display "ERROR: invalid lower bound" for invalid ${3}
    * display the message to STDERR

  * all  output is to  be to STDOUT (save  for any error  message,  which
    should be sent to STDERR)

  * validity  of output will  be based  on displayed information  AND the
    conformity of output to example display formatting

  * should lower bound be higher than upper bound, run with it: the table
    might appear slightly backward from  the usual representation, but it
    will still display the correct values for what is being multiplied

Sample Output
=============
Following will be some  example runs of the script. Use  these to aid you
in implementing your script.

Please note the output, location of line-endings, and spacing between the
provided  prompts. Your  script's output  should  match when  run in  the
particular way.

Default, no options or settings alterations

What is up  with the "11", when  we clearly said "13"? Well,  in base 12,
"11" IS  the quantity we know  of in decimal as  thirteen (13). Arguments
are  provided  in  decimal,  processing  is  done  in  whatever  base  is
specified.

All of that, plus lower bound

Spacing,  formatting, and  presentation are  centrally important.  I want
those headers and headings, and  dividing lines. Your output should match
my output (all to STDOUT).

An issue you might  run into is how much space will  you have to allocate
(you want it universal for the display  of the entire table). For that, I
say  determine the  length  of the  maximum value  being  output (ie  the
bottom-most right value). That value’s length should then influence all
the other output in the table.

=====Verification=====
For  additional  help  in  attaining output  and  formatting  compliance,
I  have  included a  copy  of  my  implementation,  which abides  by  the
project specifications.  Please compare its  output against that  of your
implementation.

Run the provided "verify" program  with whatever combination of arguments
to obtain the output that your implementation needs to reproduce.

Do NOTE: the "verify" program, on error, will exit with a non-zero value,
but it  will NOT  necessarily be  the same non-zero  value you  have been
allocated.

Additional requirements
=======================
In your  finished, submitted product, no  line in the script  should span
longer  than 90  characters. This  includes  both script  logic and  your
comments.

  * script should be called "0x0"  and be located in  this 0x0/ directory
    of the EoCE.

  * if  there are any naming  manipulations needed on the  script, create
    them as symbolic links against the "0x0" script.

  * submit  with the rest  of the EoCE, by  running "make submit"  in the
    base "eoce" directory.

  * specific  output  to  STDOUT  vs STDERR  is  important,  as  is   the
    formatting of output in regards to justification and spacing.

The resultant  script MUST be well-organized,  easy-to-read, consistently
indented  visually  showing the  encapsulated  levels  of logic,  and  be
thoroughly commented to explain each significant step of the process.
