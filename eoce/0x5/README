======Project: Make A Clock======

=====Objective=====
Read the  current time (in the  form of seconds since  the epoch- January
1st, 1970 at midnight), and display the time in the form of a hexadecimal
clock, updating every second.

=====Task=====
Write a  script that reads  the time, in the  form of the  current second
offset  since the  "start of  time", performing  the needed  mathematical
calculations on  that value, and display  the resulting date and  time to
the screen.

Aside from  obtaining the current  number of  seconds since the  start of
time,  you are  to ascertain  the various  aspects of  the date  and time
mathematically.

The displayed value should update each second.

Be sure  to provide, either as  a comment block  in the script, or  as an
obvious accompanying file,  a summary of what you did,  how to operate it
(assuming  these aren't  in  the form  of  on-screen instructions  during
operation ),  what isn't working,  what from these  specifications hasn't
been achieved.

Your end result will be assessed based on implementation and  correctness
of functionality, along with clear, ease of use operation of the program.

The usual attributes of staying within the spirit of the project, a clean
error-free operation,  good indentation,  descriptive comments,  etc. all
still apply.
