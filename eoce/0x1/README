======Project: WEB PAGE ADVENTURE======

=====Objective=====
One of  the original draws  of the early World  Wide Web, which  for most
people seems to have outpaced the general Internet in popularity, was the
ability to host web pages.

We will  be experiencing that very  task, through the manual  creation of
our own web pages, as well as the necessary UNIX-related backdrop helping
to ensure its operation.

=====URL=====
Web pages  are written  in HTML (HyperText  Markup Language),  a document
format that web browsers can interpret and render content to the screen.

They  are reached  via  URLs (Uniform  Resource  Locators), which  inform
various tools of the how, where, and what to retrieve.

  * how:  what   is  known  as   a  schema,  this  is   the  **http://**,
    **https://**, and **ftp://** that far  too often is abstracted by the
    web browser in the address bar. This  doesn't mean it is by any means
    optional: the web browser still has to insert that information.

  * where: host,  fully-qualified domain  name (FQDN), and  any resultant
    path referencing the location of content on the server

  * what:  the actual  file  we  wish to  retrieve.  Often  times, if  no
    specific file is requested, the web server can be configured to serve
    a default "**index.html**".

In our  case, we'll be  using the  Lab46 Web Server  to host our  own web
content. Piecing  together the above how,  where, and what, our  URL will
resemble the following:

  * https://lab46.g7n.org/~username/file.html

Many of you have  likely already been interacting with your  web URL as a
means of facilitating activities in other assignments.

The   "**~username**",   and   specifically   the   tilde   (~),   is   a
server-configured feature indicating your home directory's web directory,
which is **public_html/**, any content  put under that directory and made
world  readable (**public_html/**  itself  as well  as  your parent  home
directory must  both have world search  (aka execute) in order  for it to
work as well).  You may create subdirectories  under **public_html/** and
store web content under them- the same permissions requirements apply.

In some  web-server contexts, your **public_html/**  directory might also
be referred to as a sort of "document root". So if you see paths starting
with "/", that does NOT mean the  root of the filesystem, but the base of
your **public_html/** directory.

To reference any  subdirectories, merely append the  directory name after
the "**~username/**" component of the URL.

Basic rule of thumb for file permissions is as follows:

  * web pages and image assets need to be world readable

  * directories  (all   directories  from  the  home   directory  through
    directory containing your content) need to be world searchable

=====HTML=====

As indicated above,  web documents intended for viewing in  a web browser
are predominantly either written (or ultimately displayed as) HTML.

HTML uses a set of predefined tags, very much like some of the wiki-based
tags you may  have used while maintaining your  up-to-date weekly Journal
entries.

A google search for  HTML tags will turn up a  seemingly unending list of
information on  HTML and the  available tags, that information  which you
will be required to obtain to complete this project.

The basic format of many tags is of one of the two formats:

  * pair (open and close): **<p>This identifies a paragraph</p>**

  * unary (standalone):    **<img src="images/image1.png" />**

The forward  slash (stroke) is used  to identify the closing  tag, and is
also present at the end of the unary tag.

Common  mistakes are  misspelling  the  tag, or  forgetting  to close  an
opening tag.

=====Task=====
Your task for this project will be to create a series of web pages in the
form of a simple web-based adventure game.

It will  consist of a minimum  of 11 pages (1  for start page, 1  for map
page, 9  minimum for  world pages--  of course,  you can  **always** have
more), each one consisting of a room that the viewer can navigate to.

You get to come up with  the theme of your particular world/adventure. Is
it medieval? Futuristic?  Based in the Thundercats  universe? Filled with
furries?  Bronies?  Pick something  you  can  have  fun with  that  still
conforms to the requirements.

Requirements are as follows:

  * base directory is: **~/public_html/0x1/**

  * starting   page   in   your   base   directory   should   be   named:
    **adventure.html**

    * This page should have an introduction describing the nature of your
      quest/adventure

  * also in the base you  should have a **map.html** file which describes
    the world you've created

    * it should provide a "map" allowing a viewer to successfully make it
      through to the goal and avoid any obstacles

  * at least 9 additional pages making up your web-based adventure

    * each page must  have a set of links to  adjoining rooms (methods of
      connection up  to you: left,  right, up, down, north,  south, etc.)
      and clicking on the link takes you to that adjoining page

      * use relative paths  for all content references, so  your web site
        can be easily relocated without any further alterations needed.

    * there needs to be a logical connection of your rooms, so that there
      can exist  a path or  paths to enable  the viewer to  navigate from
      start to completion

    * you need  to have  (at least)  3 obstacles  of some  sort (unending
      abyss, space aliens abduct you, a hungry grue, or whatever fits the
      overall theme  of your adventure).  These can constitute  dead ends
      (and if  terminal dead  ends, should  only provide  a link  back to
      "start over").

    * each  page representing  a room  in your  world needs  to have  (at
      minimum):

      * links to adjoining rooms (even  if a terminal dead end- something
        to let the user "start over")

      * descriptions  of  what  the   viewer  encounters  in  each  room,
        providing  a narrative  enticing  the user  to  continue on  this
        adventure you've crafted for them

      * each "room" page needs to be  in its own subdirectory beneath the
        base directory,  and any associated  media files located  in that
        same directory.  At the very  least, you  must have a  minimum of
        3  subdirectories  upon which  your  adventure  is organized  and
        correctly references content amongst

  * you need to  have at least 4 images scattered  throughout your world.
    These can  be in  the form  of a visual  aid, augmenting  any textual
    description found on a given page

  * You must make use of the following:

    * text bolding
    
    * paragraphs
    
    * list
    
    * images
    
    * links
    
    * underline or italics
    
    * table

    * font color or size change

As this would be a great  opportunity to better familiarize yourself with
**vi/vim**, I will emphasize the following:

  * I want you to create these files locally on lab46, using **vim**.

  * This activity is more a focus on your file manipulation skills in the
    UNIX environment than a display of your web authoring skills.

  * Not only  am I not expecting  anyone to have any  prior web authoring
    experience, but I  am interested in seeing how  those with experience
    "cope" with a lack of any preferred "shiny" authoring tools.

    * Again, this  isn't an endeavor to  see how polished a  site you can
      make, but instead  how you deal with the  remote and administrative
      aspects of web design (which  frequently finds one interacting with
      UNIX systems).

====Deliverable====
Please provide  in this  directory a  file containing  the URL  needed to
reach your web page adventure, along  with an archive of what you've made
(have it expand into a **0x1/** subdirectory).
