unix fall2023 eoce 0x2
========================
Here you will find a script, stripping of proper formatting and comments;
it performs a task that you must  figure out and document (in the form of
comments), as you also restore proper indentation.

Note  that  the files  in  their  current  form,  while they  perform  an
operation,  are not  in the  proper form  needed for  submission (namely,
laying  out in  an  organized, easy-to-read,  consistently indented,  and
well-commented fashion; that is something you may need to figure out).

What is going  on here? Both on a global  (what functionality the script,
when properly invoked, provides) and also more local (what are particular
operations  within the  script doing  to  aid in  performing the  overall
process).

In your  finished, submitted product, no  line in the script  should span
longer  than 90  characters. This  includes  both script  logic and  your
comments.

  * this script, when completed, should be called "0x2" and be located in
    this 0x2/ directory of the eoce.

  * with the  exception of "then" and "do" statements,  no other commands
    can be separated by semi-colons

  * if  there are any naming  manipulations needed on the  script, create
    them as symbolic links against the "0x2" script.

  * submit  with the rest  of the eoce, by  running "make submit"  in the
    base "eoce" directory.

The resultant  script MUST be well-organized,  easy-to-read, consistently
indented  visually  showing the  encapsulated  levels  of logic,  and  be
thoroughly commented to explain each significant step of the process.
