pipemath - command-line pipeline math made easy (and fun!)
==========================================================
pipemath is  a collection of C  programs that performs an  indicated math
operation,  taking input  primarily  from STDIN,  and  secondarily (if  a
binary operator)  from a  command-line supplied  value. The  operation is
performed on the input(s), with the result being displayed to STDOUT.

It is so named because it is  a set of programs to perform various simple
mathematical operations  on the  command-line, specifically for  use with
pipes, which  transmute the STDOUT  output of  the process to  the pipe's
left into STDIN for the process on the pipe's right.

This also helps to give the user some experience in compiling, debbuging,
troubleshooting, and  installing software  from source  so that  they can
make use of it in their own endeavors.

NOTE: 'pipemath'  is meant to be  used in conjunction with  the 'numbers'
suite  of  tools.  Make  sure   you  have  properly  obtained,  read  the
instructions, configured,  compiled, and  installed 'numbers'  before you
proceed any further with 'pipemath'.

How to compile
==============
Before you can  use pipemath, you first need to  compile the source code.
This has been simplified with the use of a 'Makefile'. All you have to do
(provided a  capable C compiler is  installed), is to type  'make' at the
command-line and the  process should commence. You will see  each tool be
compiled, and hopefully in a successful fashion.

Troubleshooting
===============
Should something  end in failure, you  will need to investigate  what the
problem may be. Most C compilers  do an excellent job identifying a point
of issue, including  line and sometimes column information,  along with a
description of what problem it thinks it has identified.

Do  note, the  compiler isn't  always  perfect in  identifying the  exact
problem,  which is  where human  interaction  is needed:  read the  error
message, investigate the problem in the code; determine the resolution to
the noted error.

The 'Makefile'  has a parameter you  can provide, known as  "debug" which
will  cause it  to  reveal  more information  about  the compile  process
(namely, the file, and any compiler output corresponding).

A good rule of  thumb: in the event of MANY errors,  only address the top
one  at  any  given  time.  Sometimes addressing  the  first  error  will
eliminate many of the succeeding errors.

Once you  have made an  attempt at  resolving the error,  try compilation
again, looking for signs of a successful compile.

How to install
==============
In order  to make use  of pipemath for your  endeavors, you will  need to
install  them  into  some  directory  in your  PATH.  Your  personal  bin
directory, located  in the base of  your home directory (~/bin),  will do
just fine.  To install pipemath into  your own bin directory,  run 'make'
again (after successfully building them in the previous step) and provide
it the 'install' parameter.

Once  done you  should  be all  set.  Try  seeing if  the  tools are  now
available to  you (try running  'plus' or any of  the other tools-  if it
doesn't come  back saying "No such  file or directory", then  the install
was likely successful).

If not,  and you verify that  the tools were successfully  placed in your
~/bin directory, you may want to try logging out and logging back in.

Problems
========
Should  you encounter  problems  trying to  operate  the pipemath  tools,
consider the following as you debug and troubleshoot the situation:

  * are you providing input in the form of STDIN to the tool in question?

  * are you sure?  If a pipe is  involved, is the output  going into that
    pipe actually being sent to STDOUT?

Unary vs binary inputs
======================
The  command-line and  its  pipeline  facility allows  for  a channel  of
information to be  transacted between any two  processes. STDIN therefore
is one established means of input for any pipemath tool. If this were the
sole form of input for a tool, we'd consider this a unary input.

On  the other  hand, we  can  also pass  information into  a process  via
parameters, or  command-line arguments. Commands that  utilize input from
the command-line  take in an additional  form of input, now  bringing the
count of inputs of to 2. Hence: binary input.

How to use
==========
The various  pipemath tools,  named for  the mathematical  operation they
perform, are either  a binary or unary input tool.  For the binary input,
the primary input comes from STDIN,  and the secondary input comes from a
command-line supplied value.

For the unary input tools, they only take input via STDIN.

Once all required inputs have been provided, the indicated math operation
is performed with the result being displayed to STDOUT.
