numbers - helper tools for UNIX upf0 project
============================================
numbers is  a collection of  simple C programs  whose sole purpose  is to
output the numeric  representation of their namesake.

Working with the numbers suite also  helps to give users an experience in
compiling and  installing software  so that  they can make  use of  it in
their own endeavors.

How to compile
==============
Before you  can use numbers, you  first need to compile  the source code.
This has been simplified  with the use of a Makefile. All  you have to do
(provided a  capable C compiler is  installed), is to type  'make' at the
command-line and the  process should commence. You will see  each tool be
compiled, and hopefully in a successful fashion.

How to install
==============
In order  to make  use of numbers  for your endeavors,  you will  need to
install  them  into  some  directory  in your  PATH.  Your  personal bin/
directory, located in the base of your home directory is the set target.

To install  numbers into your own bin/ directory, simply run  'make' once
again, giving it a parameter of 'install'.

If you  successfully built and installed  numbers you should be  all set.
Try seeing if the tools are now  available to you (try running 'three' or
any of the other  tools- if it doesn't come back saying  "No such file or
directory", then the install was successful).

If not you may want to try logging out and logging back in for them to be
recognized as available commands.

How to use
==========
The various "numbers", named for the  single digit values they output are
simple and straightforward.  They do not require nor take  any input, and
only display their pertinent value.

By default, the  numbers tools will output to STDERR;  this may mess with
your command expansions. In order to  get the tools to display to STDOUT,
use the  'export' command and  declare the variable  "UPF0_MODE", setting
its contents to the string "true".
