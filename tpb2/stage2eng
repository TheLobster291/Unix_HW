The password that you seek is can be obtained from this file in a similar
fashion as  how you obtained  the first (from  README): non-interactively
and into a variable for later use.

PASSWORD:1s7x5JhoSZGJY

With visually-aligned data, there are various strategies for performing a
variety of manipulations to make it appear anything but.  Do not let this
deter you, and consider the following:

  * replacing spaces with a non-printable character can appear to have  a
    horizontally-deflating appearance on the data.  A character  is still
    there, as a placeholder. If spaces have been replaced, they have been
    replaced with a '\1' character.

  * replacing newlines with a non-printable character can appear to  pull
    the image longer horizontally (although less coherently,  as it joins
    all possible lines onto one long run-on line).  A character is  still
    there, as a placeholder.  If newlines have  been replaced,  they have
    been replaced with a '\2' character.

  * it might be that no contorting of original data has taken place.

  * of course, there could also be scenarios where BOTH contortions  have
    taken place.

Be mindful of this as you unravel the puzzle.

The key is  to be aware of  your data, what patterns or  symbols might be
present, and  what your data is  not. This is the  critical human element
that is added into the mix: that mystery state that so many problems find
themselves in.
