=========
Welcome to the next thrilling project in the puzzle box series! As it was
before, a piece of data has  been contorted, divided, and obfuscated, and
requires a  keen, observing eye to  suss out, unravel, and  piece it back
together in a coherent, viable form.

Some files in  the zip archive are password protected.  One such password
can  be extracted  automatically from  this document  by grepping  it for
'^PASSWORD:',  and  capturing only  the  content  AFTER  the colon  in  a
variable (that  you can then use  with other commands in  your automation
efforts).

PASSWORD:l6DzDN

Obtain the  password and figure out  how to extract what  data it unlocks
from the archive and investigate it.

Analyze  it;  this  data  is encoded  somehow.  Determine  the  potential
patterns that may  govern it, and explore different ways  of decoding it.
There may  be several  layers, manipulations, pieces,  etc. that  need to
be obtained  and eventully  extracted/decoded/deciphered/arranged/etc. to
build your final result.

Be careful, exactness  can matter! Also: reading  and observation matter.
When you assume things, and don't check to make sure your assumptions are
in fact  reality, the puzzle box  can snag you, and  deter your progress.
Manual pages remain very useful: knowing the default behaviour of a tool,
along with  what options are  available can be  make or break  in getting
through various hurdles encountered on your puzzle box journey.

As you go  along, apply your senses of pattern  matching to unjumble what
you have gotten. As always- avoid manual work: use tools on the system to
help you. You  will be again making  a steps file that should  be able to
automate the process, carrying out the non-interactive commands making up
the steps of your solving process. This file shall be called "tpb2steps",
and  you  submit it  at  the  conclusion of  your  work  on the  project,
along  with  the  fully  unravelled  product (stored  in  a  file  called
"tpb2.results").

If you execute this script (your steps file), it should non-interactively
carry out the  unravelling process (assuming the files  have been already
copied into  the current directory),  and produce the end  result without
any errors generated.

Your  steps file  should NOT  incorporate copying  of the  data from  the
public directory, nor  verifying end results, nor  submitting steps. JUST
the  process of  solving the  puzzle  (that way  you don't  have to  make
considerations for whether you are on your  pi or lab46: once you get the
tpb2 project files in place, your steps file can get to work).

In addition to  all the tools we've explored this  semester, you may want
to specifically investigate the following:

  * file(1)
  * xxd(1)
  * cut(1)
  * lzma(1)
  * ls(1)
  * rev(1)
  * ar(1)
  * xz(1)
  * grep(1)
  * tar(1)
  * sha384sum(1)
  * gzip(1)
  * head(1)
  * uudecode(1)
  * unzip(1)
  * tac(1)
  * tr(1)
  * base64(1)
  * bzip2(1)

Also,  viewing  and reading  through  any  script  logic or  source  code
provided will likely prove invaluable. Always  the aim is to have an idea
of what is going on.

EXAMPLE
=======
Included with  your files is an  EXAMPLE file, showcasing an  instance of
the format of  your own end result.  You may want to study  this file, so
you can recognize patterns of data.

You should also explore various encoding/decoding processes; encoding and
studying the EXAMPLE file, seeing what the encoded data looks like, along
with then decoding it to verify you can accomplish the decoding processes
to have a familiarity with the tools will be quite helpful.

VERIFICATION
============
In the base of the tpb2 project directory (in the unix public directory),
you will  find a MANIFEST file.  This contains the 'sha384sum'  hashes of
the correctly  unscrambled pieces and  resultant file you are  in pursuit
of. You can generate  a sum and grep for a match in  the MANIFEST file to
help ensure whether or not you have got that part.

SUBMISSION
==========
The  unraveled  product (something  visual,  coherent,  and perhaps  some
degree of BEST  CLASS YOU'VE EVER TAKEN greatness) should  be placed in a
file called "tpb2.results",  which, along with "tpb2steps",  are what you
need to submit upon project completion:

  lab46:~/src/SEMESTER/unix/tpb2$ submit unix tpb2 tpb2.results tpb2steps
